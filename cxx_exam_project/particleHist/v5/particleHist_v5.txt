---- Modify Hist_v4 and use dispatcher&observers to handle begin/end job ----

**** Part A ****

*** ok
Use the "Utilities" package already downloaded in version 4

*** ok
In "AnalysisSteering.h" remove the "process" function declaration.

*** ok
Take the following from braggPlot_v5 (and look at the differences with 
the v4 version):
- the new version of "AnalysisInfo.h",
- the new version of "AnalysisSteering.h,cc",
- the new version of "main.cc".

*** ok
In the "main" program handle begin/end job by dispatching
"AnalysisInfo::begin" or "AnalysisInfo::end" enums.

**** Part B ****

***
In "ParticleMass.cc": ok
- read the mass ranges from a text file ("massRanges") taking 
  the name from the command line through "AnalysisInfo" and allowing for
  different numbers of ranges

*** Include lifetim max. likelihood fit *** ok

In "LifetimeFit.h":
- add the following private members:
  * min and max time range (2 doubles),
  * min and max scan range (2 doubles),
  * scan step (1 double),
  * a container for all the decay times (1 std::vector<double>),
  * particle mean lifetime and error (2 doubles),
- remove the number of accepted events,
- add 5 parameters to the constructors for min. and max. time,
  min. and max. scan, scan step,
- add 2 functions "lifeTime" and "lifeTimeError" to return the mean lifetime
  and error.

In "LifetimeFit.cc": ok
- in the "add" function get the decay time from "ProperTime" and
  save it in the std::vector of all the decay times,
- in the functions "lifeTime" and "lifeTimeError" return the mean lifetime
  and error (their value is to be set in the "compute" function)
- in the "nEvents" function return the number of entries in the
  std::vector of all the decay times,
- in the "compute" function perform a max. likelihood fit to the lifetime,
  as described in the following.

The mean lifetime is estimated as the value "t" that minimizes the function:
L(t) = S_i=1^N ( (t_i/t) + log(t) + log( exp(-t_min/t) - exp(-t_max/t) ) )
where t_min and t_max are the min. and max. decay times accepted in the
analysis.

The minimum can be found performing a scan for "t" in the range [s_min,s_max],
fitting the L(t) function with a parabola L=a+bt+ct^2 and getting the
minimum as t=-b/2c . The error correspond to the range where L(t) is smaller
than Lmin+0.5 and can be computed as S(t)=1/sqrt(2c) .
The scan and fit can be performed using the "QuadraticFitter" class,
provided in the package.

So, in the "compute" function, do the following:
- instantiate a QuadraticFitter object,
- do a scan for t_s in [s_min,s_max] with steps t_step,
- for each value of t_s compute L(t_s), that implies a nested loop 
  over all the elements of the std::vector of all the decay times,
- call the "add" function giving as parameters t_s and L(t_s)
Then get mean lifetime and error using the formula given above, 
getting a, b and c from the functions "a", "b" and "c" of "QuadraticFitter".
 
***
In "ParticleLifetime.h,cc" ok

- get the mass and time ranges plus the fit parameters from text file 
  ("particleFitters"), and change the parameters of the "pCreate" function
  to handle the increased number of parameters needed by the LifetimeFit 
  constructor.
