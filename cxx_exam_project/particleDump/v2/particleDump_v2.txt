---- Modify Dump_v1 and use structs ----

Create a "Particle" struct, with members corresponding to the data
for each particle (charge, 3 momentum components).
Create an "Event" struct, with members corresponding to the data
for each event (event identifier, 3 decay point coordinates,
number of particles, array of pointers to Particle structs, i.e. Particle**).

***
Use a dynamic array for the list of pointers to Particle; create
all the Particle structs dynamically, too.

***
Create a function "read" taking as argument an input file stream,
reading an event and returning a pointer to the event or zero 
at the file end. Create the event dynamically.

***
Create a function "dump" taking as argument a reference to const-event
and printing a dump on the screen.
Write on the screen only the numbers, do not add any text as "Event number:"
or "these are the particles:"; the output should be usable as input for
a following run of the program.

***
Create a function "clear" deleting the event and its content, including
all the particles: first of all delete all the Particle structs, then
delete the array of the pointers and at last the Event struct.

***
Create a "main" function taking the file name from the command string, 
reading the file and calling the dump and clear functions.
