Projects and Exercizes done during my university career

In this repository there are some of the projects and exercised i've done during my last year of bachelor degree and first half of master degree.
The various folders contains:
- Muon source contains the project for the Module A of Computational Physics: the study of the behaviour of a muonic beam
- Root_codes contains some of the C++ programs i wrote for my thesis project, some of the data used are included in the directory but only a few due to the size.
  Most of the macros are wrote for the ROOT Cern Analysis enviroment which is used in Particle Physics so some of the graphics obtained are shown in the resutl directory.
- Cxx contains the various version of the project done for my Advanced C++ course exam
- ML contains Machine Learning assignements covering Regression, Classification and Clustering tasks, some tasks have been approached with various methons (SVM, NN...)
- Comp_Phys_ModA contains some pyhton exercises about the fondamentals of the language and it's application to some physical cases, 
  like in the Monte Carlo notebook
